# it's Mohi

Hey, I'm _Mohammad A. Ahmadian_, a hobbyist programmer who enjoys building and experimenting with new ideas.

In the past i worked with java mainly for modding and making server plugins for Minecraft.
After a long break for studing, i started programming again with javascript.

Right now im experimenting with RedwoodJS and learning Rust.

I like React.
I love Typescript and Next.js.
